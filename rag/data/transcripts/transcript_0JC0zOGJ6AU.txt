00:00:10: how to install decode receipt printer
00:00:14: which by the way come in two models
00:00:16: dc3r1 and DC tr3
00:00:21: and with this printer you get a CD in
00:00:24: which you get all the useful softwares
00:00:27: utility softwares tools and drivers
00:00:31: right so these are the contents so we'll
00:00:35: try and see what do we get inside the
00:00:37: driver so you have a Linux driver
00:00:40: a virtual.com driver and a Windows Drive
00:00:44: so this is the Windows driver for your
00:00:46: Windows PC but just in case if you
00:00:49: happen to lose this particular CD
00:00:52: you simply have to go to your web
00:00:54: browser and log on to
00:00:56: decodeinternational.com
00:00:58: [Music]
00:01:00: right so this is the website
00:01:03: just wait for the second yes so you have
00:01:06: to go to the download section and you
00:01:09: will be able to find all the utility
00:01:11: softwares and drivers whatever you need
00:01:14: for the decode Hardware right so let's
00:01:17: try and install the driver
00:01:20: let's agree to the license agreement
00:01:22: next next next
00:01:24: and then finally click on finish
00:01:28: and then this particular window will pop
00:01:31: up and whatever operating system you're
00:01:33: using this particular driver will pick
00:01:35: it up which in this case is Windows 11.
00:01:38: then we've connected this printer with
00:01:41: USB so it has picked up USB as the
00:01:44: interface and you have to select pause
00:01:46: ATC if you are using dc3r1 and 3r3
00:01:51: and then it is asking whether you want
00:01:54: to configure the printer now which we
00:01:56: say yes
00:01:58: so we have to find pause 80s written
00:02:03: somewhere yes so we will select this
00:02:04: particular USB port and then click on
00:02:08: apply
00:02:09: and then ok
00:02:12: once we're done with this we simply have
00:02:14: to go to the devices and printer section
00:02:17: we'll find this pause ATC driver
00:02:20: installed which means our driver is
00:02:23: installed successfully
00:02:25: then let's try and go to the preferences
00:02:27: Advanced options
00:02:29: and you will be able to find the paper
00:02:32: size which by default is 80 by 297 for
00:02:37: most cases this 80x297 as a default will
00:02:41: work for you otherwise you can change
00:02:43: the printer size sorry receipt size as
00:02:46: per your convenience
00:02:48: so let's try and print the test page
00:02:50: here is the test page let's drive and
00:02:53: print once more so here's the second
00:02:56: test page which means our printer is
00:02:58: installed successfully
00:03:00: which comes with a pre-installed Auto
00:03:03: cutter
00:03:04: so this was the installation of decode
00:03:06: receipt printer thank you so much for

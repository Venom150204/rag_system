00:02:34: so as and when we attach this dongle in
00:02:37: a computer you will be able to see the
00:02:39: signal strength which means
00:02:41: this dongle is now connected with this
00:02:44: scanner
00:02:46: and once we enter the scan gun mode
00:02:49: we'll we have some barcodes right in
00:02:52: front of us let's try and scan the
00:02:54: barcodes
00:02:55: so when we scan the barcode you will be
00:02:58: able to see that this scanner or this
00:03:02: mode is wirelessly transmitting the data
00:03:05: on a real-time basis
00:03:08: right
00:03:10: and you'll be able to find the length of

00:03:49: transmitted because these barcodes are
00:03:52: being collected into the memory of this
00:03:54: particular scanner and you can see the
00:03:56: details that you have scanned nine
00:03:59: barcodes
00:04:00: and now to export all the collected data

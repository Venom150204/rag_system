00:01:05: by the way installation process of all
00:01:07: the decode barcode printers is
00:01:09: absolutely same so if you've learned how
00:01:11: to download one printer you've learned
00:01:13: how to download every decode backward
00:01:15: printer
00:01:16: right let's click next check on run and
00:01:20: then you have to click finish
00:01:22: [Music]
00:01:24: so that this will start our installation
00:01:27: process
00:01:30: so we have to wait for the window to pop
00:01:32: up yes so this is our install wizard
00:01:35: let's click on next this is the default
00:01:38: printer name
00:01:39: you can leave it as it is or if you want
00:01:42: to rename your barcode printer you can
00:01:44: rename it as per your convenience let's
00:01:47: click on finish
00:01:49: and wait for the installation to
00:01:51: complete
00:01:52: so this completes our installation
00:01:55: successfully
00:01:57: we'll have to close this particular
00:01:59: window and then we'll have to go to the
00:02:01: control panel which in this case we have
00:02:04: saved this particular shortcut on the
00:02:07: desktop devices and printers section
00:02:10: this is our default printer name two
00:02:13: zero five four we'll go to the printer
00:02:15: properties
00:02:17: firstly we'll have to check for ports so
00:02:20: if your printer accept the default Port
00:02:23: then mellingwood otherwise you'll have
00:02:25: to test individual ports one by one
00:02:29: to see which Port is being accepted by
00:02:32: your barcode printer in general
00:02:35: we have to go to the preference Tab and
00:02:39: we have different default
00:02:42: label sizes otherwise you can set up
00:02:45: your own custom size
00:02:47: for example let's name this particular
00:02:50: label as 100 into 50m we have named it
00:02:53: then let's resize it
00:02:55: this is the format of 100 into 50 mm
00:02:58: barcode label right so let's go to the
00:03:03: advanced options once we've set up the
00:03:06: custom size
00:03:07: so so if we have some tolerance around
00:03:09: the label we can select
00:03:12: horizontal or vertical offset otherwise
00:03:14: we can straight away go to Graphics
00:03:16: select the contrast of the labels which
00:03:18: we can more often than not select on
00:03:21: none
00:03:22: we have to select the thermal printing
00:03:25: technology which is direct thermal in
00:03:27: case of Amazon and Flipkart labels and
00:03:29: thermal transfer in case of
00:03:31: ribbon barcodes after that we have to
00:03:35: select the media type if these labels
00:03:38: are with gaps without gaps with black
00:03:40: marks or continuous roles we have to
00:03:42: select that
00:03:43: then in options we have we can select
00:03:46: the darkness of the label or the print
00:03:50: which we want
00:03:52: once we select the darkness we are ready
00:03:55: to apply the changes and print the test
00:03:57: page right so let's try and print the
00:04:00: test page this is the test page let's
00:04:03: try and print this again
00:04:05: now we have the second label and this
00:04:07: completes the setup of our barcode
00:04:10: printer

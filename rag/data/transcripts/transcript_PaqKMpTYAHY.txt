00:00:13: two wide Scanners from decode
00:00:16: firstly
00:00:17: dc5121 which is a 2d Barcode Scanner
00:00:20: secondly
00:00:21: dc511 which is a 1D barcode scanner
00:00:25: so let's try and unbox the model dc5
00:00:28: triple one first and
00:00:30: and see what do we have inside
00:00:32: firstly we have a programming manual
00:00:34: which will help you program the barcode
00:00:37: scanner secondly we get a USB cable
00:00:42: and lastly we get this beautiful scanner
00:00:46: from decode dc5 triple one
00:00:49: and this is trigger and we can use this
00:00:53: slot to attach the USB cable which we've
00:00:56: got along with the barcode scanner
00:01:00: so this particular end we'll insert it
00:01:03: into the scanner and the other end will
00:01:05: be inserted into the computer
00:01:08: so this was the unboxing of dc5 triple
00:01:11: one
00:01:12: and now let's try and unbox
00:01:15: dc5121
00:01:16: from decode
00:01:19: so again we get a programming manual
00:01:23: which will help you to program the
00:01:26: barcode scanner
00:01:27: secondly you get this
00:01:30: USB cable
00:01:33: right so it will help you attach the
00:01:37: Bargo scanner to the computer
00:01:40: and this is the 2D backwards kind of
00:01:44: dc5121 is the 2D scan engine
00:01:48: and let's try and attach the USB cable
00:01:52: here is there
00:01:53: so
00:01:55: this is how we attach the cables
00:01:59: now let's try and plug these scanners
00:02:02: into a computer and let's try to switch
00:02:04: on these two barcode scanner
00:02:07: so as and when we insert the cables you
00:02:11: can see these green lights will tell you
00:02:13: that in the dust scanners are switched
00:02:15: on so 2D Barcode Scanner will throw a
00:02:18: window beam and the 1D scanner will
00:02:21: throw a laser beam now let's try and
00:02:24: test these scanners firstly dc511
00:02:27: [Music]
00:02:34: and now let's try and test dc5121
00:02:38: [Music]
00:02:48: and you can use this scanner to scan 1D
00:02:51: barcodes as well
00:02:54: [Music]
00:02:58: so this was the unboxing and
00:03:01: installation of white Scanners from
00:03:03: decode
00:03:04: thank you so much for watching the video

00:00:18: first of all let's try and find out what
00:00:21: do we have inside the Box
00:00:23: so let's see
00:00:25: okay so first of all we'll find a user
00:00:29: manual which will guide you how to
00:00:32: install this particular scanner
00:00:34: secondly
00:00:36: we have one USB cable
00:00:38: with the help of which you can connect
00:00:40: this scanner to any computer
00:00:44: and lastly
00:00:47: this is our presentation scanner
00:00:51: dc5142
00:00:53: [Music]
00:00:54: right
00:00:56: and as you can see it has a huge scan
00:00:59: screen which gives you a huge scan area
00:01:03: it has one touch control for sound and
00:01:05: alarm
00:01:07: at the back you have this USB slot
00:01:10: and you can insert the USB cable inside
00:01:13: this and the second end can be inserted
00:01:16: into a computer and you can start using
00:01:20: this particular scanner
00:01:23: and now
00:01:25: let's try and switch on this scanner for
00:01:29: this we have to plug in the second end
00:01:32: of the cable into a computer
00:01:42: and once it is switched on within start
00:01:46: using this scanner for the purpose of
00:01:48: testing we have one small QR code one
00:01:52: large QR code one large 1D barcode and
00:01:55: one small one day barcode
00:01:59: and let's try and see how this panel
00:02:02: works
00:02:04: and as you can see these blinking lights
00:02:07: will tell you that it has already
00:02:09: started to scan all these barcodes
00:02:11: but since we have a rotating motor
00:02:15: let's try and find out the speed of this
00:02:18: scan engine that how fast this
00:02:21: particular scan engine actually is
00:02:24: and let's try and start this rotating
00:02:27: motor to check the scan speed
00:02:46: so this was the unboxing and
00:02:49: installation of dc5142
00:02:52: thank you for watching the video

00:00:10: dc3m
00:00:14: a Bluetooth Mobile printer from decode
00:00:18: so as you can see it can print both
00:00:20: labels as well as receipts
00:00:23: so these are the labels and this is the
00:00:26: kind of receipts it can print for the
00:00:29: purpose of demonstration let's try this
00:00:31: printer on receipts first so this is the
00:00:34: power button let's press it
00:00:37: and long press will switch this print on
00:00:40: and it is ready but since there is no
00:00:42: media it says no paper
00:00:44: so with the help of this little red
00:00:46: button on the right
00:00:48: we'll open the printer and there is this
00:00:51: little label guide if at all you want to
00:00:54: insert
00:00:56: these smaller size receipts or labels
00:00:59: so we'll insert the receipt Rule and
00:01:03: with the help of setting button
00:01:05: will be able to see let's go into the
00:01:08: running mode and let's see what is the
00:01:09: current mode
00:01:11: and it is already selected as the
00:01:13: receipt mode so we'll let this be and go
00:01:17: to the main screen
00:01:18: and test the printer we'll have to
00:01:21: connect the printer first with the help
00:01:24: of Bluetooth so let's go into the
00:01:27: settings of this particular mobile phone
00:01:29: let's switch on Bluetooth
00:01:32: and the first option
00:01:35: 4b2043pb is our printer let's click on
00:01:38: that and let's enter zero zero zero zero
00:01:41: to pair the phone with our printer
00:01:45: so as you can see it is already paired
00:01:47: now we'll go into the application code
00:01:50: barcode and you can find this particular
00:01:53: application in Play Store
00:01:56: so we'll have to click on the printer
00:01:58: icon first which is given on top right
00:02:01: of the application we'll click on
00:02:02: Bluetooth connection and we'll simply
00:02:05: click on refresh
00:02:08: so it is now connected so as you can see
00:02:11: we've already pre-made several
00:02:15: label formats for you already but let's
00:02:18: click on new for the purpose of demo
00:02:21: let's name this label as test
00:02:24: and since this is a three inch model our
00:02:27: label width
00:02:29: would be 75 mm let's keep the height at
00:02:32: 50 mm
00:02:33: and let's click on new and this is our
00:02:37: final label format which is ready to be
00:02:39: formatted
00:02:40: we are now inserting one simple barcode
00:02:43: and then this particular text for the
00:02:46: purpose of testing let's
00:02:49: insert our text as this particular model
00:02:52: only which is DC 3M mobile printer
00:02:57: let's format this
00:02:59: all right so now a format is complete
00:03:03: and let's try and print
00:03:06: so once you click on confirm print
00:03:09: and here we go and if you want to print
00:03:11: multiple copies you click on print icon
00:03:15: and then
00:03:16: you can print as many copies you want
00:03:20: so this is your printout and this was
00:03:22: demo for receipt mode
00:03:25: and now let's take out the receipt role
00:03:28: to test the label mode
00:03:31: so we'll simply take out the receipts
00:03:33: and insert the label rules
00:03:36: and we have to insert the labels facing
00:03:40: up only
00:03:41: and now let's go into the settings
00:03:44: running mode
00:03:48: yeah so as you can see it is on receipt
00:03:51: mode we have to press on feed button to
00:03:53: scroll
00:03:53: and once it is on the label mode will
00:03:56: press the setting button
00:04:00: yes now it is ready now we will just
00:04:03: press feed button once to check
00:04:06: if it is
00:04:08: stopping on the tier of position
00:04:10: yes so now finally our printer is ready
00:04:14: to be tested on label mode Let's go back
00:04:17: to our power barcode application
00:04:21: and now let's click on settings
00:04:25: so as you can see the switcher mode it
00:04:27: is on receipt mode and we'll have to
00:04:30: switch this application from receipt to
00:04:33: label mode
00:04:34: so once we click on new
00:04:37: we'll get the same window to format the
00:04:41: label design
00:04:44: here we have entered the particulars
00:04:47: label name as test label width 75 and
00:04:51: label height is 50.
00:04:53: and once we click on new
00:04:55: it will give us the label format window
00:05:00: so for the purpose of testing let's
00:05:01: insert one simple 1D barcode and one
00:05:05: simple 2D QR code
00:05:08: so our label format is ready to be
00:05:11: tested and now we'll just simply click
00:05:14: on the printer icon
00:05:17: and confirm print
00:05:21: here we go we have a printout and now
00:05:24: let's try and print multiple copies
00:05:27: [Music]
00:05:30: in from print and here we go here we
00:05:32: have the multiple copies
00:05:35: so this was the demo of decode dc3m

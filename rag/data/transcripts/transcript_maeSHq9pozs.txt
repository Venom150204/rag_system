00:00:18: dc5112bt which is a 1D Barcode Scanner
00:00:21: and
00:00:22: dc5122bt which is a 2d barcode scanner
00:00:25: so let's try and unbox both these
00:00:28: scanners one by one
00:00:30: so
00:00:31: this is the programming manual which can
00:00:34: be used to change the settings of the
00:00:37: scanner
00:00:38: secondly you'll be able to find a USB
00:00:41: cable which can be used to charge the
00:00:43: scanner as well as transparency
00:00:46: [Music]
00:00:47: then
00:00:49: you will find a 2.4 gigahertz dongle
00:00:53: which can be used to transmit the data
00:00:56: with the help of radio frequency and
00:00:58: lastly this is the Bluetooth barcode
00:01:01: scanner
00:01:04: and with a press of the trigger you'll
00:01:08: be able to switch on the scan
00:01:10: now let's unbox the kudi barcode scanner

00:01:18: here as well you will be able to find
00:01:20: all the manuals and cables and
00:01:23: everything and the reason we call this a
00:01:26: three in one scanner is that you can use
00:01:29: this particular cable to transmit the
00:01:31: data and use this as a wide scanner
00:01:34: and then use this particular dongle and
00:01:37: use this as a wireless Scanner with the
00:01:40: help of radio frequency
00:01:42: and lastly you can use the Bluetooth
00:01:44: mode to
00:01:46: connect your smart devices directly
00:01:49: without the help of any dongle or any
00:01:51: wire
00:01:53: and to know how to connect the scanner
00:01:56: with the help of the wire or the dongle
00:02:00: we have posted separate videos for the
00:02:04: wide scanner and the wireless scanner
00:02:05: you can refer those videos
00:02:07: in this video we'll try and connect this
00:02:11: scanner
00:02:12: to a computer with the help of Bluetooth
00:02:15: directly so in order to connect
00:02:18: the barcode scanner we just have to
00:02:21: Simply scan this particular barcode
00:02:25: which says Bluetooth hid mode
00:02:28: yeah so this is now clear and then match
00:02:31: so let's try and scan this particular
00:02:33: barcode and then match
00:02:35: and now this blinking light will tell
00:02:37: you that this is in pairing mode now
00:02:40: let's go to a computer screen and try
00:02:43: and connect this particular Barcode
00:02:44: Scanner we'll try and open the Bluetooth
00:02:47: settings
00:02:49: yeah so we'll simply click on ADD device
00:02:53: and let's see yeah so a computer now is
00:02:59: able to find this particular scanner and
00:03:02: then we will simply connect this
00:03:05: now it is connected and ready to be
00:03:07: tested
00:03:11: and now let's try and test the Bluetooth
00:03:14: barcode scanner from decode
